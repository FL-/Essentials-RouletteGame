# Roulette Minigame
This script is for Pok√©mon Essentials. It's the Roulette Game Corner minigame from Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald. This minigame isn't an exact adaptation of the official one, the ball never stops at an occupied slot, so there's no Taillow and Shroomish bonus. The ball chance is 1/free slots quantity.
